# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

automatically be published to Packagist within a few minutes.
